# Robert Boscacci

Data engineer at [SilverRide](https://silverride.com/), working across Azure and AWS to help older adults get where they need to go. Former film colorist with [IMDb credits](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4574526/) and author of [The Spring of Sight](https://robertboscacci.com/book/), a book about computer vision and where it's taking us as a society.

I use Cursor but am thinking to transition to pure Claude Code.

I like cycling, urban mobility, and community maker spaces. I moved from Brooklyn to Seattle with my wife and two cats and I've been meaning to revitalize my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rboscacci1/). When I'm not perfecting biga pizza dough or cold-brewing 3L of medium-light roast, I'm playing [Arc Raiders](https://www.arcraiders.com/) or (in warmer months) backpacking and rock climbing.

I write about [backpacking in the Olympics](https://robertboscacci.com/blog/2025/olympics-backpacking/), [MLOps meetups](https://robertboscacci.com/blog/2023/2023-06-22_spotify_mlops_meetup/), [entrepreneurship notes](https://robertboscacci.com/blog/2024/2024-01/2024-01-20_entrepreneurship/), and other things on [my blog](https://robertboscacci.com/blog/). Longer-form technical work lives on my [projects page](https://robertboscacci.com/projects/).
