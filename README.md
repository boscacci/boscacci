# Robert Boscacci

Data engineer at [SilverRide](https://silverride.com/), working across Azure and AWS to help older adults get where they need to go. Former film colorist with [IMDb credits](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4574526/) and author of [The Spring of Sight](https://robertboscacci.com/book/), a book about computer vision and where it's taking us as a society.

I went to a data science bootcamp in 2018 and never looked back. These days I'm getting accustomed to multi-agent development workflows.

When I'm not at a terminal I'm usually cold-brewing 3L of medium-light roast at a time, perfecting biga pizza dough, or playing [Arc Raiders](https://www.arcraiders.com/). In warmer months: backpacking, cycling, rock climbing. I write about some of that on [my blog](https://robertboscacci.com/blog/), and I keep a [projects page](https://robertboscacci.com/projects/) with the longer-form technical stuff.
