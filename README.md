I like cycling, urban mobility, and community maker spaces. I moved from Brooklyn to Seattle with my two cats and I've been meaning to revitalize my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rboscacci1/). When I'm not perfecting biga pizza dough or cold-brewing 3L of medium-light roast, I'm playing [Arc Raiders](https://www.arcraiders.com/) or (in warmer months) backpacking and rock climbing.

I write about [backpacking in the Olympics](https://robertboscacci.com/blog/2025/olympics-backpacking/), [MLOps meetups](https://robertboscacci.com/blog/2023/2023-06-22_spotify_mlops_meetup/), [entrepreneurship notes](https://robertboscacci.com/blog/2024/2024-01/2024-01-20_entrepreneurship/), and other things on [my blog](https://robertboscacci.com/blog/). Longer-form technical work lives on my [projects page](https://robertboscacci.com/projects/).
